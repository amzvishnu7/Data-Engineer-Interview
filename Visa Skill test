Question - Server Selection

Some developers want to deploy their application on different servers with a load balancer in the front. There are n servers to choose from where the number of requests that can be handled by the ith server is server[i]. The number of requests served by any server is a power of 2 i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8,
16,...etc. Given the array server and an integer expected_load, find the minimum number of servers that must be chosen such that the total sum of requests served by all the chosen servers is exactly equal to the expected_load. If there is no combination of servers that can serve exactly expected load requests, report -1 as the answer.

Example

Suppose n = 4, servers = [1, 1, 2, 4], and expected_load = 3.
It is optimal to choose the first and the third or the second and the third servers serving a total of 1 + 2 = expected_load = 3 requests. Return the minimum number of servers needed, 2.

Function Description:

Complete the function getMinServers in the editor below.

The function getMinServers has the following parameter: int expected_load: the number of requests to be served int server[n]: the number of requests the servers can serve
Return int: the minimum number of servers such that the sum of the total requests they can serve is exactly expected_load
